* About
A toy example that reproduces a crash which occurs with sdl2-mixer callbacks.

SBCL Crashes when a GC is triggered from a foreign thread callback. This doesn't crash if a GC is explicitly called (i.e. `sb-ext:gc` from user code does not crash).

This demo spins up a foreign thread and allocates a bunch of memory on it. Eventually a GC is triggered and lisp crashes.

To run:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(progn
   (load "crash.lisp")
   (run-crash-demo))
#+END_SRC
